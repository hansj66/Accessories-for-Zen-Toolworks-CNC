Accessories-for-Zen-Toolworks-CNC
=================================

Description

This is a set of accessories that I designed for my Zen Toolworks CNC.

1) Shop vac interface

2) Y-axis homing/limit switch bracket.

Instructions

Limit-switches for Z & X-axis can be mountet on the original frame without additional support.
The Y-axis limit switch bracket can accomodate a standard arcade style microswitch, and allows for maximum table travel in the Y direction.

The vacuum interface allows for a 4 cm diameter flexi tube, but can easily be modified to accomodate other diameters. Use hot glue to secure the flexi tube to interface part d and b. 

These parts were designed for the 7x7" version. I suspect that they also might fit the 12x12" version, but I haven't verified this.

PS. You may need to modify parts a & b slightly if you plan on re-using the original screws for mounting these (I used plastite screws with smaller diameter heads)
